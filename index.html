            Hi, I'm Dave and I'm an aspiring web developer. My path to this point has been perhaps a bit unusual. In college, I realized that I love nature -- birds especially -- and majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan. After earning my BS, I took the next step toward becoming a professor and earned an MS from Auburn University, where I studied the evolution of bird genomes. As much as nature fascinates me, academia irritates me, and through a lengthy and difficult process I decided I'm better off elsewhere. However, not a total loss, my experience in academia provided me a great deal of practice analyzing complex problems and -- fortuitously -- coding.

            After researching many new career options, I decided the satisfation I got from coding -- along with my general affinity for abstract thinking, problem solving, and creativity -- pointed me toward the world of web development. To this end, I have recently begun a six-month "coding bootcamp" at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. There, I aim to build my web development skills to where I can compete for entry-level developer jobs upon completion of the program.

            Outside of career aspirations, I love to bird (basically birdwatching, but a lot more fun), hike, play and watch a myriad of sports, lift weights, think about how coding and nature can be combined, and learn about the world in any way I can. Please take a look at my professional portfolio and feel free to contact me for any reason. Thanks!
        </p>
